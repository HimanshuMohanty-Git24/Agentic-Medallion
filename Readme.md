## 🚀 Project Overview

This project represents a groundbreaking fusion of **AI-powered automation** and **enterprise data engineering**, creating the world's first fully autonomous data transformation pipeline using the **Medallion Architecture** on Databricks. Built during my internship at Accenture, this system leverages **agentic AI** to automatically plan, generate, review, and execute data transformations with zero human intervention.

### 🎯 What Makes This Revolutionary?

- **Fully Autonomous**: AI agents handle the entire ETL process from planning to execution
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic error detection and code correction through agent collaboration
- **Production-Ready**: Handles real-world data quality issues and edge cases
- **Observable**: Complete tracing and monitoring with LangSmith integration
- **Scalable**: Built on Databricks serverless architecture for enterprise-scale workloads

## 📖 The Genesis Story

### The Learning Journey

While interning at **Accenture**, I gained firsthand exposure to how enterprise data transformations are handled for Fortune 500 clients. The complexity, manual effort, and repetitive nature of ETL processes sparked an idea: *What if AI agents could automate this entire workflow?*

During my exploration of the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold data layers), I realized this pattern was perfect for agentic automation. Each transformation stage has clear requirements and validation rules that AI agents could understand and implement.

### The Breakthrough Moment

The convergence of three key insights led to this project:

1. **Accenture Experience**: Witnessing large-scale client data transformations
2. **Medallion Architecture Learning**: Understanding the structured approach to data lakehouse design
3. **Agentic AI Background**: Recognizing how AI agents could orchestrate complex workflows

### Databricks Free Trial Journey

This entire project was built using **Databricks' 14-day free trial** with **$400 in credits**, proving that cutting-edge AI infrastructure is accessible to innovators worldwide. The serverless **Mosaic AI Agent Framework** platform provided the perfect foundation for building production-grade agentic systems.
